# What is âš¡ThunderBalancer?

It is fast http load balancer for your API/webpage

## Benefits

* ThunderBalancer makes choice based on experience with nodes performance (response time)
* It supports three different http server engines: http.Server, fasthttp and our custom, pure socket-based ThunderEngine
* Choosing the next node makes zero memory allocations
* TLS support out-of-box
* Wide support of HTTP 1.1 methods, cookies, etc.

## How to use
#### Option 1
Run the binary with ENV variables. Every ENV variable is required to be set.
#### Option 2
Start the docker container with ENV variables.

| FAST_HTTP     | Alternative http server. Can be up to 10x faster (authors declare it). Based on zero-allocation approach | Faster than http.server. Uses less RAM. [ More about it.](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)        | May contain more bugs, supported by maintainers of fasthttp.                                                        |
| THUNDER       | Experimental, very fast engine based on pure sockets without parsing of http request/response.           | Very fast. Uses extremely small amount of RAM. Works as pipe: retranslates the requests and responses | Experimental. Not advised for production usage until 1.0 version. Can contain bugs with some configuration of nodes |
